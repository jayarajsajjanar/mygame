***Additional properties added to models***
1) For 'get_game_history', a new model named 'Moves' was implemented which was used to store the move made at every step of the game. Also, to implement functionalities like 'get_high_scores','get_user_rankings','get_game_history' etc, new properties were added and a few existing ones were modified. 

2)In User model - 'total_guesses' and 'total_points' properties were added. These two properties were addded in 'User' model and not in 'Score' model because -- 'Score' model was intended to store individual games data and not cumulative ones. 

'total_guesses' and 'total_points' i.e. cumulative unlike 'Score' model, are updated after every game finishes. 

3)In Game model -  'random_number_assigned' was added.'random_number_assigned' is used to randomly assign a question for that particular game. 

4)'HighScoreForms' and 'HighScoreForm' forms were added to carry outbound high score information.

5)'MoveForms' and 'MoveForm' was added to carry outbound 'Move' information.



***Implementing game logic***
1)For the game 'quizz', providing random questions for the game was a challenge. Additional property 'random_number_assigned' was added in 'Game' model to make the randomly assigned question and answer accessbile throught the program. 

2)In 'get_game_history', the 'moves' returned were not in order. Hence, a DateTimeProperty field called 'time_created' was added and was used in ordering the query results. 

2)Implementing the leaderboard too was a challenge as the cumulative points of the users were needed. This necessitated the need for additional properties for 'User' model.

3)Mailing logic too was modified so that a mail is sent to the user with pending games every 10 minutes.
